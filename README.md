# Marketing-Campaign 
To evaluate the effectiveness of two different marketing campaign strategies (Facebook and Adword) by conducting an A/B test, with the goal of improving user engagement and conversion rates

## Problem Statement:

We need to determine the which ad campaign yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions and overall cost effectiveness. By identifying most effective platform, resources can be allocated more efficiently and optimise advertaising strategies to deliver better outcomes. 

### A/B Testing:
A/B Testing is a statistical method used to compare two versions of a variable (Version A and Version B) to determine which one performs better against a defined goal (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate, time on site).

## Solution Approach:

### Data Collection and Cleaning:

1.Gather campaign data including ad_views, ad_clicks, ad_conversions, cost_per_ad, conversion_rate,cost_per_click, click_to_rate for both Facebook and Adword campaign.

2.Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

### Outcome:

Apply hypothesis testing, A/B Testing to understand most effective campaign out of Facebook and Adword.
Apply Regression Analysis to predict the Target(Conversions) variable using independent variables.
